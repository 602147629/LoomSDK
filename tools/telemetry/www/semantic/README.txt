This dir contains the necessary source and distribution files for Semantic UI.
If you wish to update the dist files, you need to have "gulp" installed and then run "gulp build".
Run just "gulp" to watch the source files for changes, run "gulp help" to view all the available tasks.

Direc
dist - contains the stripped down, compiled files ready for distribution / packaging (WARNING: do not change the files in this folder as the changes may be lost)
